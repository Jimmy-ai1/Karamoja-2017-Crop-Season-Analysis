## Overview

[Karamoja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karamoja) is the **most food-insecure** region of Uganda mainly as a result of low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks.

Several NGOs **provide technical support as well as farm inputs** to local farmers but their **efforts are hindered by limited visibility into the overall state of the region.** They rely heavily on fragmented local sources of information, making it difficult to target interventions effectively. In response, Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) applied a satellite-based methodology to remotely estimate crop yields for the region's two staple crops (sorghum and maize) during the 2017 season.

This project focuses on **creating an interactive visualizations of these results**, which will serve as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring Tool to guide future NGO activities.

## Business Objectives

The main objective of this project is to **develop an interactive visualization tool that supports NGOs in monitoring food security** conditions across Karamoja. Specifically, the project seeks to:
- Integrate population and production data to **highlight areas where food availabilty is critically low.**
- **Visualize crop contribution for sorghum and maize** using satellite-based estimates at both district and subcounty levels.
- **Visualize crop yields for sorghum and maize** using satellite-based estimates at both district and subcounty levels.
- **Identify priority areas for NGO intervention** by revealing patterns of low productivity and high vulnerabilty.
- **Enable interactive exploration** through maps, charts and filters that allow users to compare regions and crop performance.

## Data Understanding

The data used in this analysis consists of **two datasets** which provide information concerning **yield and production of staple crops** (maize and sorghum) for **districts** and **sub-counties** in Uganda. The data provides the farming area in hectares, crop yield of both crops in hectares, productivity of both crops individually in kilograms as well as the population of the districts and sub-counties.

## Results

The chart highlights Kotido's dominance in sorghum production, suggesting that sorghum is likely the best performing in that district. Maize production is relatively stronger in Nakapiripirit and Napak compared to other districts. The disparity in production volumes points to differences in land area, soil suitability, or farmer preference for crop type across districts.

Kabong and Nakapiripirit perform well in maize yields (13,851 kg/Ha and 9,353 kg/Ha resp.), far surpassing other districts. Sorghum yields are genereally lower across all districts, with Kaabang (3,664 kg/Ha) and Abim (2,582 kg/Ha) showing the strongest performance for sorghum. Moroto has the lowest yields for both crops indicating poor perfomance.

Although Kotido leads in production volumes, its yield per hectare is lower then Kaabang's and Nakapiripirit's. This suggests that Kotido has a large are pf cultivation but lower efficiency, while Kaabang achieves better productivity per unit area. Sorghum appears less productive then maize overall, possibly due to lower inputs, poor agronomic practices, or environmental limitations.

Nakupiripirit and Kotido lead in per capita production (87.98 and 82.29) respectively, indicating that relative to population, these districts produce a surplus. Kaabang and especially Moroto are the lowest (24.64 and 5.56 resp.), showing significant production pressure relative to population.

Nakupiripirit and Kotido are better positioned to meet household food needs and may even have surplases. On the other hand, Moroto shows critical underproduction, raising concerns about food shortages and dependency on imports or aid. Kaabang's low production per capita value, despite high yields, suggests population pressure or smaller total cultivated area relative to population size.
